How to add files from github, and how to upload files to github

1. cmd line command 'git clone <html>'                (copies repo into folder from html)
  \na. 'makedir FOLDER_NAME'                          (makes new folder)
  \nb. 'cd..'                                         (moves into parent folder)
  \nc. 'mv OLD_NAME NEW_NAME'                         (renames a file)
  \nd. 'mv WHICH_FILE DESTINATION'                    (move WHICH_FILE to DESTINATION)

3. cmd line command 'git add FILE_NAME'                  (adds a file)
