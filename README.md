How to add files from github, and how to upload files to github

1. cmd line command 'git clone <html>'                (copies repo into folder from html)
  \na. 'makedir <folder>'                             (makes new folder)
  \nb. 'cd..'                                         (moves into parent folder)
  \nc. 'mv <old_name> <new_name>'                     (renames a file)
  \nd. 'mv <which_file> <destination>'                (move a file)

2. cmd line command 'git status'                      (shows status of current versions)

3. cmd line command 'git add <file>'                  (adds a file)

4. cmd line command 'git commit -m <message editor wants to add to version>'

5. cmd line command 'git push origin master'          (uploads everything to online github repo on master branch)

Branch mechanics

1. cmd line command 'git branch'                      (shows all branches)

2. cmd line command 'git branch <branch name>'        (creates <branch name> branch)

3. cmd line command 'git checkout <branch name>'      (switches user to <branch name>)

4. cmd line command 'git push origin <branch name>'   (uploads everything to online github repo on <branch name> branch)
